### Hand-crafted and brewed from scratch with love, for the modern sophisticated-developer, to build robust PHP applications.

Release: Gentleman Jack `gentlejack` ü§µ

Version: 0.0.5

### Getting started with whiskeybox on Windows.
* GIT 2.22.0.windows.1 or higher *(Required)*
* Oracle VM Virtual Box 6.1.8 or higher with corresponding Extension Pack installed *(Required)*
* Vagrant 2.2.9 *(Required)*
* PhpStorm 2020.1 *(Required as of now for the documentation)*

1\) Enable Virtualization in your BIOS. Sometimes this setting will be off on new machines by default. Refer to your 
motherboard's BIOS documentation for more details and how you can enable it.
_________________

2\) Open '**Git Bash**' and clone the repository...
```shell script
   git clone https://github.com/W3G33K/whiskeybox.git /c/Projects/whiskeybox
```
Please note; you must clone into '**/c/Projects/whiskeybox**' for default PhpStorm configurations to work.
_________________

3\) Open PhpStorm, select '**install whiskeybox vm (as a host)**' from the PhpStorm Run Configurations dropdown in the 
upper right-hand corner and then click on the green run button. Depending upon your local PhpStorm settings, Windows will 
prompt you with User Account Control window asking if you want to give the PhpStorm Run Configuration permission to run. 
Click yes. Windows will prompt you with a command-line interface window containing this message: 

`Do you want to install whiskeybox vm as a host on this machine? (Y/N)`

Type **Y** and press enter on your keyboard. The PhpStorm Run Configuration will install whiskeybox vm as a host on your
local machine. Once it has completed updating your hosts file you'll see the message: 

`You have installed whiskeybox vm as a host on this machine.`

After you `vagrant up` you will always be able to access your installation of whiskeybox from:

[http://whiskeybox.local/](http://whiskeybox.local/) or [http://www.whiskeybox.local/](http://www.whiskeybox.local/)

Please note; steps one to three are only needed once per single installation of whiskeybox.
